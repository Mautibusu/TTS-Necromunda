# TTS-Necromunda
Table Top Simulator Assets for the game Necromunda

# How to use models:
Quick, one-time way: 
- "Download zip" from this page
- Extract resulting archive, and place "models" folder into your TTS saved objects folder. On Windows machines it should be here "{USER}\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator\Saves\Saved Objects"
- launch TTS, and load a table
- in TTS, click "objects->saved objects" and browse to the files you recently added from the zip archive.
- as usual, you can adjust the scale, change the name, ... and start using the model!

Extensive way:
- If you have followed the steps to contribute to this repo, you most likely have cloned the files in the proper location for TTS to directly show in "saved objects" the contents of the repo.
- You can keep up to date with the latest releases by pulling the latest version from the git repo!

Notes:
- take care of taking good pictures!
- the unity part is NOT needed.
- you can use cylinder.obj as collider
- Scale your model in TTS, and save it as an object.
