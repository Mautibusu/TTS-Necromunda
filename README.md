# TTS-Necromunda
Table Top Simulator (TTS) Assets for the game Necromunda.

{intro text and overview of contents}

### Background info about TTS and the models
{summary of things that matter for users and content creators + pointers}

### How to use models in TTS:
From the Steam Workshop:
- look for the collection "Necromunda: 3D Scanned Models" by UristMcDerp.
- Fastest, but might not be 100% up to date with the models in this repo (could have more, could have less).

Quick, one-time way:
- get .json and .png files from the "models" folder in this repo.
- place "models" (.json + .png files) into your TTS "Saved Objects" folder. On Windows machines it should be here "{USER}\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator\Saves\Saved Objects"
- you can get the whole contents of the repo by hitting "Download zip" (green button top right), and filter out what you want

Extensive way:
- If you follow the steps to contribute to this repo, you most likely have cloned the files in the proper location for TTS to directly show in "saved objects" the contents of the repo.
- You can keep up to date with the latest releases by pulling the latest version from the git repo!

Notes:
- take care of taking good pictures!
- the unity part is NOT needed.
- you can use cylinder.obj as collider
- Scale your model in TTS, and save it as an object.
- See the "contribute" section for a detailed workflow
