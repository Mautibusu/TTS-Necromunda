This folder contains the TTS usable models. You can get these models into TTS by:
- download both files: {Model_Name}.json and {Model_Name}.png files
- place them into your TTS "Saved Objects" folder. On Windows machines it should be here "{User}\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator\Saves\Saved Objects"

You can find actual files for the assets (3D file, texture file, and raw assets e.g. pictures) in the "raw" folder.
