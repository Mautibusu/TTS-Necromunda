Note: TTS uses local cache. So, when you push a new version of a file, it will not be downloaded again by TTS if the name is the same.
Cache is here:
{USER}\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator\Mods\
You should remove all files from the repo from models, image, and raw versions. THEN TTS will download the latest version of the file.
