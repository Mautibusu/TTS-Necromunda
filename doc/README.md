Note: TTS uses local cache. So, when you push a new version of a file, it will not be downloaded again by TTS if the name is the same.

You should remove all files that contain "httpsrawgithubusercontentcomMautibusuTTSNecromunda" in the cache folder, which is here:
{USER}\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator\Mods\
Next time you load a mod or a save that uses these models, TTS will download the latest version of the file from Github.
